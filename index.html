        <p>
          Envious of his friend Bucky Barnes’ military enlistment, and
          undeterred by his own multiple rejections by the U.S. Army, physical
          weakling Steve Rogers made one more attempt to join the march of men
          to fight for their country in the dark days of World War II. Rogers’
          valiant wish to fight bullies wherever they were grabbed the attention
          of scientist Dr. Abraham Erskine, and he handpicked the idealistic
          young man for the Army’s Super-Soldier program under his supervision.

          captured troops, including his old friend Bucky Barnes, Captain
          America quickly earned the respect and admiration. And it was not only
          from the soldiers he fought alongside, but also from British secret
          agent Peggy Carter, an expert on Hydra, who had served as Erskine’s
          assistant on the Super-Soldier program. After a series of battles
          overseas, Rogers, Barnes, and the Howling Commandos strike force
          staged an assault on a train carrying Hydra personnel, during which
          Barnes seemingly fell to his death. Grieving over the loss, Rogers
          nevertheless continued his campaign against Hydra, while also growing
